* About

This is a project of a dormitory management system website designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of managing dormitories or student housing. The website addresses the specific challenges faced by dormitory management, such as managing room assignments, maintaining accurate occupancy records, and processing billing and payment information. The proposed system provides user registration and login, room assignment management, and payment processing functionality. The website was implemented using a combination of programming languages and frameworks, and rigorous testing and validation processes were performed to ensure its reliability and effectiveness. The results of the project showed that the website provided significant benefits to both students and administrators, such as reducing paperwork, increasing transparency, and improving communication. The report concludes with potential areas for future development and improvement, such as integrating with other campus management systems or adding new features to the website. Overall, the dormitory management system website has the potential to revolutionize the management of dormitories and student housing, and provide significant benefits to both students and administrators.

The basic things that we're looking for is fulfilment of all facilities shown this video: https://youtu.be/5u11Gv-wc_U

- *Visual Booking facility:* Allow users visual representation of rooms,
  something like: hotel online book with view system. There Wil be section Boys
  and Girls hall in frontend and they can choose their own seat from the
  available(only available seat will be shown).

    data's: Hall, Room, Seat.

- *Online Payment:* After Signup form submit, user data will be stored in database
  but with inactive status. To activate account user have to pay the rent in
  advance. There will be shown a =Complete Payment= button to pay online after
  submitting the registration form.
